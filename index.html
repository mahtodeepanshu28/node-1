    <h1>Node JS</h1>

    <p>Node.js is a cross-platform runtime environment and library for running JavaScript applications outside the browser. It is used for creating server-side and networking web applications.</p>
    <p>Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library  </p>
    <pre>        Extremely fast: Node.js is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, so its library is very fast in code execution.

        I/O is Asynchronous and Event Driven: All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous i.e. non-blocking. So a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call. It is also a reason that it is very fast.
        
        Single threaded: Node.js follows a single threaded model with event looping.
        
        Highly Scalable: Node.js is highly scalable because event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way.
        
        No buffering: Node.js cuts down the overall processing time while uploading audio and video files. Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
        
        Open source: Node.js has an open source community which has produced many excellent modules to add additional capabilities to Node.js applications.
        
        License: Node.js is released under the MIT license.</pre>
